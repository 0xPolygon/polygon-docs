The diagram below depicts a simplified architectural layout of the CDK FEP config and indicates at a high level how components communicate.

### Component Interactions

- The **CLI tool** is the starting point. Developers, or chain administrators in particular, use the CLI tool to build and configure chains in various modes of operation, such as validiums and rollups.
- Once a chain is configured with the CLI, users can submit transactions through the **CDK Erigon RPC node**. These transactions are relayed to the `tx-pool manager` before the sequencer selects and executes them.
- The **sequencer** sequences transaction batches and synchronizes data with the **RPC node**.
- The **sequencer sender** reads batch data from the RPC node.
- The **aggregator** reads batch data from the sequencer data stream.
- The sequencer sender persists data into the **L1 smart contract domain** for rollup mode and into **DAC nodes** for validium mode operations.
- The aggregator sends batches to the **prover** and receives proofs in return. Together with the prover, it aggregates the proofs into batches before submitting the final proofs to the **Agglayer** or L1, depending on the chosen settlement layer.
- Users interact with the **bridge service** via the **bridge UI** or **API**.
- The Agglayer verifies proofs and interacts with the **L1 smart contracts**.

### User Data Flow

The following diagram sequentially depicts the user data flow for the CDK FEP config in validium mode using a mock prover and an Agglayer connection.

### Sequential Interactions

1. The user sends a transaction to the **CDK Erigon RPC node**.
2. The **CDK Erigon RPC node** proxies the data to the **CDK Erigon sequencer node** and syncs the batch data between the sequencer and the RPC nodes.
3. The sequencer sequences the transaction batches.
4. The **sequencer sender** reads batches from the RPC node.
5. In validium mode only, the sequencer sender persists transaction data into the **DAC nodes**.
6. The sequencer sender sequences the batches into the **L1 smart contracts**.
7. The **aggregator** reads batches from the sequencer data stream.
8. The aggregator sends batches to the **provers**.
9. The aggregator submits the final proof to the **Agglayer**.
10. The Agglayer submits the final proof to the **L1 smart contract domain**.
