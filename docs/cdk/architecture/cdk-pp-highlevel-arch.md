The figure below depicts a simplified, high-level view of the CDK chain architecture using pessimistic proofs and the flow of transactions through the system.

## Transaction Flow

Here is a step-by-step flow of transactions starting from when users submit transactions up to when the transactions are settled in L1:

1. A user connects to the chain via a CDK Erigon RPC node and submits a transaction.
2. CDK Erigon RPC node sends the transaction data to the transaction-pool manager.
3. The transaction-pool manager proxies all transaction data to the CDK Erigon sequencer.
4. CDK Erigon sequencer executes transactions, puts the transactions in blocks, and the blocks fill up batches.
5. Any CDK Erigon RPC node syncs transaction data from the CDK Erigon sequencer.
6. AggSender gets batch data from the CDK Erigon sequencer, uses the data to generate certificates, and submits the certificates to the AggLayer RPC.
7. The AggLayer RPC checks the validity of the certificates against the transaction data in the CDK Erigon RPC node.
8. After validating the certificates, the AggLayer RPC sends a request to generate a proof, together with the necessary data (including the certificates), to the SP1 prover.
9. Once the proof is received from the SP1 prover, the AggLayer RPC sends it to L1.
