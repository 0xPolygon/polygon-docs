### What are Full Execution Proofs?

Full Execution Proofs (FEP) are zero-knowledge proofs that validate the correctness of a chain’s entire state transition. They ensure that the virtual machine (VM) underlying the chain (e.g., Polygon zkEVM, Succinct's zkVM, or MoveVM) executes state transitions in compliance with the protocol's specifications.

#### Key features:
- Comprehensive validation: Verifies that all state transitions adhere to predefined rules.
- Scalability: Supports high-throughput applications in both rollup and validium modes.
- Interoperability: Facilitates seamless interactions across Layer 2 chains and with Ethereum Layer 1.

By leveraging Full Execution Proofs, CDK configs help achieve scalability, security, and interoperability tailored to specific use cases.

### Why use Full Execution Proofs?

- **Security:** Ensures that all state transitions on the chain are executed correctly.
- **Flexibility:** Supports multiple configs, including rollup and validium modes, balancing scalability and security.
- **Developer-friendly:** Simplifies the process of building and deploying Layer 2 solutions with pre-built components.

Full Execution Proofs provide developers with tools to build robust, secure, and interoperable Layer 2 chains.


### How Full Execution Proofs work

Full Execution Proofs validate the entire state transition of a chain using cryptographic proofs. These proofs are generated by the chain’s prover and submitted to Ethereum Layer 1 for validation.

#### Workflow:
1. **Transaction submission:** Transactions are sent to the chain’s sequencer.
2. **State transition execution:** The virtual machine executes all state transitions on the chain.
3. **Proof generation:** The prover generates zero-knowledge proofs for the executed state transitions.
4. **Validation:** Proofs are submitted to Ethereum Layer 1 for verification.

This ensures that state transitions are secure, trustless, and fully validated.
