### What are Pessimistic Proofs?

Pessimistic Proofs (PP) are zero-knowledge proofs that validate the correctness of bridge transitions and ensure the collateralization of all withdrawals. They provide a trustless mechanism for secure cross-chain interactions between chains configured with the CDK Sovereign Config and the Agglayer.

#### Key Features:
- **Bridge validation:** Ensures transactions processed through the unified bridge are correct.
- **Withdrawal collateralization:** Confirms all withdrawals are properly collateralized, preventing unauthorized asset transfers.
- **Trustless interoperability:** Facilitates secure and seamless cross-chain communication.

### Why use Pessimistic Proofs?

- **Secure cross-chain interactions:** Ensures trustless interoperability between chains using the Sovereign Config and the Agglayer.
- **Robust validation mechanism:** Validates bridge transitions and withdrawal collateralization for every transaction.
- **Developer-friendly architecture:** Modular components simplify implementation and accelerate development timelines.

Pessimistic Proofs enable developers to build robust, secure, and interoperable chains that seamlessly interact with the Agglayer.

### How Pessimistic Proofs work

Pessimistic Proofs validate cross-chain transactions by using cryptographic zero-knowledge proofs to ensure secure and trustless interactions between chains. These proofs safeguard the integrity of bridge operations and withdrawal processes.

#### Workflow:
1. **Transaction submission:** Transactions are sent to the chain’s sequencer.
2. **Certificate generation:** The AggSender aggregates transaction data and sends certificates to the Agglayer node.
3. **Proof generation:** The SP1 prover in the Agglayer generates zero-knowledge proofs based on the certificates.
4. **Validation:** The Agglayer node validates the proofs and finalizes the transactions.

This ensures that all transactions are secure, trustlessly verified, and transparently executed.
