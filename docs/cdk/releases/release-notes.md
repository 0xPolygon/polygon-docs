# Benefits

## Multistack Architecture
Choose between stacks based on your project needs:
- `cdk-opgeth` offers fast launch times and the familiarity of Geth and OP Stack
- `cdk-erigon` provides granular control and customization, from gas tokens to core stack components

## Unified Liquidity and State
CDK chains are Agglayer-native, meaning they share liquidity, state, and messaging by default—powering cross-chain UX and composable dApps.

## Zero-Knowledge Security
Every chain mode is ZK-backed:
- **Sovereign**: Optimized for cost with pessimistic proofs
- **Validium**: Off-chain data, on-chain integrity
- **zkRollup**: Full ZK security and scalability

## EVM-Equivalent Development
Build using the same tooling, smart contracts, and workflows you're already familiar with. 100% EVM compatibility, zero rewriting.

## Accelerated Deployment
Reduce time-to-launch with:
- Open-source components
- Preconfigured Kurtosis local dev environments
- Implementation support from Conduit (cdk-opgeth) and Gateway.fm (cdk-erigon) for production ready chains

## Infrastructure for Aggregated Web3
With CDK, you're not building a siloed L2—you’re contributing to an aggregated, interoperable blockchain future.
