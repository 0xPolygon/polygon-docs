## What’s New in Fork ID 12?

### **1. Full Execution Proofs**
- **Trustless Finality:** Advanced zk-based finality ensures transactions are secure, decentralized, and verified without reliance on centralized entities.
- **Customizable Proving Systems:** Developers have full control to define and optimize proof configurations for zk rollups, validium setups, or Agglayer-native configurations.

### **2. Erigon Integration**
- **High-Speed Data Syncing:** Integrates the Erigon client to deliver faster syncing and improved resource efficiency, enabling high transaction throughput.
- **Seamless Ethereum Compatibility:** Leverages Erigon’s Ethereum foundation, ensuring smooth integration with Ethereum tooling and infrastructure.

### **3. Prover System Upgrades**
- **Increased Proving Capacity:** Expanded zkCounter limits now support complex computation and higher throughput.
- **Faster Proof Generation:** Optimized proof pipelines reduce time-to-deployment and enhance performance in production environments.

### **4. Developer Tooling Improvements**
- **Refined CLI:** A more intuitive and streamlined command-line interface simplifies chain deployment, configuration, and testing.
- **Documentation Updates:** New and improved guides provide step-by-step instructions for deploying, customizing, and migrating L2 chains.
