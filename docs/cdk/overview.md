Polygon Chain Development Kit (CDK) is a modular, open source, software toolkit for blockchain developers which supports the installation and configuration of a variety of chain architectures. 

Polygon CDK empowers developers to launch new L2 chains running Polygon zkEVM technology on Ethereum or, with optional validium networks and, in the future, transition existing layer 1 (L1) chains into custom ZK-EVM L2s. 

## CDK features

Polygon CDK provides the components necessary to build a layer 2 blockchain that is secure, scalable, and interoperable with other chains. Below are some of the key features of CDK:

- Security: CDK builds high-performance, high-security, scalable L2s that utilize the latest innovations in zero-knowledge technology such as [Plonky3](../innovation-design/plonky.md#plonky-3).

- Scalability: Transaction fees are orders of magnitude lower than Ethereum and processed substantially faster. This enables a fast, cheap, and secure user experience unaffected by any high activity experienced on shared networks.

- Modularity: CDK modular components allow developers to easily customize their L2 environment and build a chain that meets their specific needs.

- Interoperability: Opt-in to the [AggLayer](../innovation-design/agglayer/overview.md) to bootstrap your chain's ecosystem, enable cross-chain transactions expanding your reach and user base, while attracting users and liquidity from other established chains.

- Sovereignty: Maintain full control over your chain's revenue, governance, security, economic policies, and more.

## Dive deeper into CDK

Polygon CDK gives developers a toolkit for sovereign and modular chain design, without sacrificing future interoperability with other L2 chains. 

Chains built with Polygon CDK will have access to an ecosystem of (forthcoming) unified liquidity, optimized performance, and seamless asset transfers, all while prioritizing user experience and data security.

### Where to now?

- [Deploy a local CDK on Kurtosis](./getting-started/local-deployment.md). Follow the guide to deploy a CDK stack on your local machine.

- Check out the [concepts documentation](./concepts/layer2s.md) to understand the CDK at a high level.

- Have a look at the [CDK architecture docs](https://docs.polygon.technology/cdk/architecture/cdk-zkevm/) to understand the CDK's components and how they interact with each other.
