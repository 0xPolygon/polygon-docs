The **Polygon Chain Development Kit (CDK)** is a modular, open-source toolkit for building highly customizable Ethereum-compatible layer 2s. Designed to empower developers to build for their use case, CDK enables the deployment of Layer 2 solutions optimized for performance, security, and cost-efficiency.

## Flexible Configurations

Polygon CDK supports a range of configurations, enabling developers to customize their Layer 2 to specific needs:
- **Rollup Configurations:** Fully secured by Ethereum using zero-knowledge proofs for trustless scalability and decentralization.  
- **Validium Configurations:** Utilize off-chain data availability for reduced costs and higher throughput.  
- **Agglayer Native Configurations:** Cost-optimized setups natively connected to the Agglayer and secured by pessimistic proofs. These configurations offer a lightweight, affordable option with ecosystem-level security.

## Key Advantages

Polygon CDK provides the essential components to build Layer 2 solutions that are secure, scalable, and interoperable with other chains.

- **Security:** CDK builds highly secure L2 solutions using the latest innovations in zero-knowledge technology and pessimistic proofs.  
- **High Performance:** CDK integrates fast-syncing Erigon clients and the battle-tested Polygon zkEVM protocol for scalable, low-latency operations.  
- **Modularity:** CDK’s modular architecture allows developers to easily customize their environment, including finality mechanisms, proving systems, and economic policies.  
- **Interoperability:** Opt-in to the [Agglayer](../agglayer/overview.md) to bootstrap your chain’s ecosystem, enable cross-chain transactions, and expand your reach, user base, and liquidity from other established chains.  
- **Cost Efficiency:** Agglayer native configurations provide low-cost options with reduced gas fees and fast transaction processing, making them ideal for budget-conscious projects.
