# Overview

The **Polygon Chain Development Kit (CDK)** is a modular, open-source framework for building custom Layer 2 (L2) chains tailored to any use case. With **Polygon CDK**, developers can configure and deploy scalable, Ethereum-compatible chains using cutting-edge zk and aggregated blockchain technology.

## Key Configurations

Polygon CDK enables flexible deployment options, including:
- **Rollup Configurations**: Maximize security by leveraging on-chain data availability.
- **Validium Configurations**: Optimize scalability with off-chain data availability.
- **Agglayer Native Configuration**: A cost-effective, performance-driven configuration connected to the Agglayer, secured by **pessimistic proofs**. Ideal for projects requiring independent operations with unified liquidity.

This modular design ensures projects can scale securely, minimize costs, and deliver high performance while maintaining full customization.

## Why Choose Polygon CDK?

- **Customization**: Tailor your chain’s performance, cost, and security to your exact needs.
- **Scalability**: Configurations support high transaction volumes with minimal latency.
- **Interoperability**: Native Agglayer integration connects chains for unified liquidity and cross-chain compatibility.
- **Cost Efficiency**: Options like the Agglayer Native Configuration minimize costs without sacrificing performance.
- **Upgradability**: Seamlessly transition to advanced features like Full Execution Proofs as your project scales.
