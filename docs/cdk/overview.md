The **Polygon Chain Development Kit (CDK)** is a modular, open-source framework for building scalable and secure Layer 2s (L2s). Designed for flexibility, the Polygon CDK stack has 3 main configurations (with options to customize further): zk rollup config, validium config, and the Agglayer native config.

## Why Use Polygon CDK?

### **1. Build ZK-Powered Chains**
Polygon CDK enables developers to launch chains using cutting-edge zero-knowledge (ZK) technology for:
- **Trustless Finality**: Transactions are validated without relying on centralized authorities.
- **Maximum Security**: Leverage zk-proofs to safeguard user data and ensure cryptographic integrity.

### **2. Modular Architecture**
- **Customizable Components**: Select and configure modules like consensus, data availability, and proving systems to fit your use case.
- **Future-Ready Design**: Adapt your chain as requirements evolve or new technologies emerge.

### **3. Interoperability**
- **Agglayer Integration**: Seamlessly connect to Agglayer for cross-chain functionality and ecosystem bootstrapping.
- **Ethereum-Compatible**: Build on a foundation that supports Ethereum tooling, enabling easy adoption and user migration.

### **4. High Performance**
- **Erigon Client**: Benefit from faster syncing and high transaction throughput powered by the optimized Erigon architecture.
- **Cost Efficiency**: Reduce transaction fees by orders of magnitude compared to Ethereum Layer 1.

### **5. Sovereignty**
Maintain full control over your chainâ€™s:
- Governance and revenue.
- Security policies and economic frameworks.
- Finality and operational structure.
