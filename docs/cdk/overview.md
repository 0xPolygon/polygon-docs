### What is Polygon CDK

Polygon CDK is a modular, open-source framework for building Ethereum-compatible Layer 2 blockchains. It enables developers to configure their Layer 2 to meet specific use cases, such as:

- zk-Rollup: For high throughput and trustless finality using zero-knowledge proofs.
- Validium: For cost-efficient scalability with off-chain data availability.
- Sovereign: For interoperability and shared liquidity secured via pessimistic proofs.

Polygon CDK allows developers to build scalable and customizable Layer 2 blockchains while leveraging Ethereumâ€™s security and existing ecosystem.
