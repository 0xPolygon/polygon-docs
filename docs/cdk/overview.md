# Overview

Launch your Layer 2 â€“ your way.

The Agglayer Chain Development Kit (CDK) is a multistack, production-ready toolkit for building Ethereum Layer 2 (L2) chains with native connectivity to Agglayer. Chains built with CDK share unified liquidity, composability, and secure interoperability across Web3.

With CDK, developers can:

- Choose the best-fit stack: `cdk-opgeth` for OP Stack familiarity or `cdk-erigon` for extensive customizability
- Launch Sovereign, Validium, or zkRollup chains backed by zero-knowledge proofs
- Leverage plug-and-play connectivity to Agglayer for instant access to shared state and liquidity
- Use Ethereum-native tooling without needing to relearn new frameworks

CDK is modular, Ethereum-aligned, and designed to scale from testnet to production in days.

### Who Is CDK For?
- **Web3 Developers**: Deploy app-specific chains with full control over execution, DA, and tokens
- **Builders & Founders**: Spin up performant, low-cost chains with support from expert implementation providers
- **Enterprises**: Launch secure, scalable L2 infrastructure with deep configurability and proven uptime
