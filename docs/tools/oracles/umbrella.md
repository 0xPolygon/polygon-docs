[Umbrella Network](https://umb.network/) is a decentralized oracle service that provides blockchain projects with secure, scalable, and customizable data solutions.

The service leverages a network of decentralized community validators to ensure the reliability of the oracle data.

## Solutions

Umbrella Network provides three data consumption options: on-chain data, layer 2 data, and on-demand data.

### On-chain data

Retrieve data feeds directly on-chain. Projects can define parameters such as deviation triggers and heartbeat to manage the frequency and precision of the updates. This is the simplest and most straightforward approach for reading data.

### Layer-2 data

Read data feeds off-chain and verify them on-chain to ensure secure utilization within your dApp. Prices are regularly updated off-chain at a predefined frequency, and web3 apps fetch this data when needed and submit it on-chain. This approach is particularly advantageous when your project necessitates handling large volumes of data, as storing it entirely on-chain would be cost-prohibitive.

### On-demand data

On-demand data fetching planned for Q3 2023.
