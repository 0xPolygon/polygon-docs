**Razor network** is a decentralized oracle providing data to the smart contracts using a network of stakers. The network consists of validators who lock in their tokens as a **stake** and provide data to the network. The honest validators are rewarded and those who report incoherently are penalized.

The core of Razor Network is a set of smart contracts that can run on any Ethereum-compatible blockchain. Razor relies on the underlying blockchain for providing certain properties such as censorship resistance, security from network partition attacks, etc.

## Usage

This oracle network is currently running on the Polygon mainnet and testnet. To get started with connecting to the data feed, check out this **[tutorial](https://docs.razor.network/)**.

The Razor Network can be explored using [Razorscan](https://razorscan.io/).
