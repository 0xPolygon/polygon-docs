The Polygon Faucet is a tool provided by Polygon and ecosystem partners like Alchemy, QuickNode, and GetBlock. It enables developers to acquire free MATIC/ETH test tokens on the PoS Amoy and zkEVM Cardona testnets. Start deploying and testing your dApps on the Polygon network with test tokens that allow you to explore Polygon features without spending actual MATIC tokens on the mainnet.

Polygon Faucet drips:

- MATIC on PoS Amoy and Ethereum Sepolia.
- Test ETH on zkEVM Cardona.

!!! info "Testnet tokens hold no real-world value"
      Tokens on testnets such as PoS Amoy, Ethereum Sepolia, and zkEVM Cardona hold no real value and are solely used for testing purposes.

Several faucet tools are available to receive test MATIC and ETH on Sepolia-anchored Polygon networks:
