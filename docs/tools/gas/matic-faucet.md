!!! info "Testnet tokens hold no real-world value"
      Tokens on testnets such as PoS Amoy, Ethereum Sepolia, and zkEVM Cardona hold no real value and are solely used for testing purposes.

Several faucet tools are available to receive test POL and ETH on Sepolia-anchored Polygon networks:

## Polygon Faucet

The Polygon Faucet is a tool provided by Polygon and ecosystem partners like Alchemy, QuickNode, and GetBlock. It enables developers to acquire free POL/ETH test tokens on the PoS Amoy and zkEVM Cardona testnets. Start deploying and testing your dApps on the Polygon network with test tokens that allow you to explore Polygon features without spending actual POL tokens on the mainnet.

Polygon Faucet drips:

- POL on PoS Amoy.
- POL and a dummy ERC20 token on Ethereum Sepolia.
- Test ETH on zkEVM Cardona.

- Start by navigating to [faucet.polygon.technology](https://faucet.polygon.technology/) and connecting/verifying your Discord by selecting **Connect Discord** in the top-right corner of the page.

- Select one of the blockchain testnet networks from the drop-down list. We'll select **Polygon zkEVM (cardona)** for this example.

- Select the type of token you want to receive; zkEVM ETH in this case.

- Copy your wallet address and either paste it directly in the **Wallet Address** field, or select **Paste**. Typing is disabled to prevent entering a wrong address.

- Select **Submit**. 

- Verify the details and select **Confirm** to finalize the transaction.

!!! tip "Always maintain sufficient test token balance"

      If you don't have enough POL/ETH test tokens in your wallet account to pay for gas fees when sending transactions, the action will fail. If you require testnet tokens in bulk, please fill out [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSe4npoGldJknEs9EBtPaV3AS-0HTso2IuMWDCiMmLEMCx8euQ/viewform).

## Alchemy Faucet

!!! tip "Get 0.5 Amoy POL"
      If you sign up or log in with an Alchemy account, you get 0.5 POL per day. Without an account, you get 0.2.

- You can request POL tokens from Alchemy's Amoy Faucet. In order to receive testnet tokens, head over to the [Alchemy Polygon Amoy POL faucet](https://www.alchemy.com/faucets/polygon-amoy), enter your wallet address and hit the **Send Me POL** button.
