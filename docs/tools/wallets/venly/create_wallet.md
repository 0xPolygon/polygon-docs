If you are looking for a user-friendly wallet on Polygon network, consider creating a [Venly (prev. Arkane Network)](https://www.venly.io/) wallet. It allows you to enable a recovery mechanism and comes with end-user support via their in-app chat.
## Sign Up to Venly

**Step 1 &rarr;** Navigate to the official [Venly](https://www.venly.io/) website and click on the **My Wallet** button in the top right corner.

**Step 3 &rarr;** After signing up with one of your social accounts or with your email-id and password, you will need to accept their terms and conditions.

**Step 4 &rarr;** To secure the wallet, you need to configure a PIN. Keep in mind that your PIN should be between 4 to 6 digits. After entering the PIN, press **Set** and it will take you to the [Venly Wallet](https://wallet.venly.io/) page.

## Create Your Wallet

Now that you've configured your PIN, you are all set to create a Polygon wallet. Select Polygon from the list of various blockchain networks listed on Venly.

To create a new wallet, select **Create New Wallet**. In case if you already have one, select the **Import Wallet** option to retrieve your wallet.

Once you've pressed the button, Venly will ask you to confirm the new wallet creation using your PIN (the one you configured a few steps before). After that your wallet will be created and you will be taken to your dashboard.

**Congratulations!** You have now created your Polygon wallet using Venly to manage your digital assets on the Polygon network.
