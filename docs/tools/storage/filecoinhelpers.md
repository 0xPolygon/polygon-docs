Filecoin is built on top of IPFS and supports storing data long-term via on-chain deals. Together, they help us break free from centralized services while conveniently allowing us to enjoy the same luxuries of speed and guaranteed storage that centralized services would bring.

## Storage helpers (IPFS + Filecoin)

- [Spheron.Network](https://spheron.network/): Deploy, manage & scale your applications utilising Web3 Infrastructure. ([video](https://youtu.be/cxMFpU6q7XI?si=ZCcIH1Segmsly0qE)).

- [Lighthouse.storage](https://lighthouse.storage/): Permanent storage on IPFS and Filecoin that allows users to pay once and store forever. Lighthouse can also be used to store private data and build token gated applications on Filecoin.

- [Web3.storage](https://web3.storage): Data storage service that stores and retrieves data on IPFS and Filecoin ([video](https://youtu.be/lPEqg6oL3Nk)).

- [NFT.Storage Flagship Product](https://nft.storage/nft-storage-flagship-product): NFT storage service that stores and retrieves data relating to NFTs on IPFS and Filecoin for a one-time fee charged per GB of storage.
