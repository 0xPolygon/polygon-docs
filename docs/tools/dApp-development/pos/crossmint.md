Crossmint is an enterprise-grade web3 development platform, allowing you to build NFT applications without requiring any blockchain experience or holding cryptocurrency, and making the blockchain invisible to end users. The platform offers a one-stop-shop for most of your NFT infrastructure needs across all major chains, including creating, distributing, selling, storing digital assets, and offering post-mint utility. 

## Create a contract

To create a new smart contract using Crossmint's Developer Console, follow the steps below.

!!! info 
    - Crossmint has two developer console environments, they are `Staging`, which works with contracts deployed on a testnet and `Production` which works with contracts deployed on a mainnet. 
    - Please use the staging environment to familiarize yourself with Crossmint before proceeding with the Production environment. 

1. Navigate to the [Crossmint's developer console page:](https://staging.crossmint.com/console/overview/?utm_source=backlinks&utm_medium=docs&utm_campaign=polygon)
