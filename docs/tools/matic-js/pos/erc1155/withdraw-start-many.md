The `withdrawStartMany` method can be used to initiate the withdraw process which will burn the specified amounts of multiple token respectively on polygon chain.

```js
const erc1155Token = posClient.erc1155(<child token address>);

const result = await erc1155Token.withdrawStartMany([<token id1>, <token id2>],[<amount1>,<amount2>]);

const txHash = await result.getTransactionHash();

const txReceipt = await result.getReceipt();

```
