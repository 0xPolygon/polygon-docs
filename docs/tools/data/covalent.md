    to get started.

## Supported endpoints

All [__Class A__](https://www.covalenthq.com/docs/api/#tag--Class-A) endpoints are supported for the Matic mainnet and the Amoy testnet. You can query either network via the unified API by changing the `chainName`.

!!! info "Endpoints"

    A full list of all the requests you are able to do on the Polygon network using Covalent are available on the [Covalent API documentation](https://www.covalenthq.com/docs/api/).

## Appendix

### MATIC gas token

To interact with Polygon network, MATIC tokens are required to pay gas fees. Covalent's responses automatically return `gas_*` fields in MATIC units.

### Token mapping

Covalent maintains an on-chain real-time mapping of token addresses between the Ethereum mainnet and Polygon. These addresses are used to reverse-lookup prices on MATIC and also to return the right token logo URLs.

Some example of mapped tokens:

|Token|Ethereum mainnet|Matic mainnet|
|---|---|---|
|USDT|0xdac17f958d2ee523a2206206994597c13d831ec7|0xc2132d05d31c914a87c6611c10748aeb04b58e8f|
|Uniswap UNI|0x1f9840a85d5af5bf1d1762f925bdaddc4201f984|0xb33eaad8d922b1083446dc23f610c2567fb5180f|

### Token prices

For tokens that have a mapping back to Ethereum mainnet, Covalent is able to return the mapped prices.
