Polygon Labs takes the following approach in regards to smart contract security.

## Secure coding guidelines

Smart contract codebases must be organized, readable, and understandable across multiple developers and project phases.

Engineers tasked with developing such codebases follow industry-standard, secure coding practices and style guides, such as https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/style-guide.html and https://github.com/coinbase/solidity-style-guide.

## Internal assessments

Polygon Labs application security teams are composed of senior & staff security engineers that perform internal reviews on all code developed. This in-house expertise allows us to follow standard methodologies for assessments using available tooling for static analyzing, line-by-line manual reviews, fuzzing, and formal verification where applicable.

## External assessments

After internal reviews, and based on a risk assessment, new smart contracts and major changes/upgrades are sent to reputable, tier 1 security consultancy organizations for a formal external security assessment. Polygon Labs periodically rotates vendors to ensure an unbiased view of the code.
