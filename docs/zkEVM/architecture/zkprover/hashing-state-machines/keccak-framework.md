The zkEVM, as an L2 zk-Rollup for Ethereum, employs the Keccak hash function to achieve seamless compatibility with the Ethereum blockchain at Layer 1. However, rather than implementing a single state machine that performs four different tasks, the zkEVM does so in a framework of four state machines:

1. The Padding-KK SM is used for padding purposes, as well as validation of hash-related computations pertaining to the Main SM's queries. As depicted in the figure below, the Padding-KK SM is the Main SM's gateway to the Keccak hashing framework.

2. The Padding-KK-Bit SM converts between two string formats, the bytes of the Padding-KK SM to the bits of the Keccak-F Hashing SM, and vice-versa.

3. The Bits2Field SM is used specifically for parallelizing Keccak-F SM implementation. It acts as a multiplexer between the Padding-KK-Bit SM and the Keccak-F SM. This state machine is called _Bits2Field_ because it ensures correct packing of bits from $44$ different blocks of the Padding-KK-Bit SM into a single field element. In other words, it is a $44$-bits-to-$1$-field-element multiplexer.

4. The Keccak-F SM computes string hashes at the request of the Main SM. Although the Keccak-F SM is a binary circuit, it operates on a _44-bits-by-44-bits_ basis rather than a bit-by-bit basis. This equates to running four $44$ hashing circuits in parallel.
