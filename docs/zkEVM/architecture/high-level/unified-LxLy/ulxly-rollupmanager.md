Unified bridge is a specific instance of the LxLy bridge that allows several chains to connect to it. It is designed for adding chains to the Polygon ecosystem, and thus allow interoperability of many chains, both L2 and L1 networks.

It aims at streamlining the creation and management of different L2 layers within the Polygon network. This includes rollups and validiums among the Polygon network, ensuring possible exchanges of messages among them.

    While it is technically imprecise, for the sake of simplicity, we will henceforth refer to both rollups and validiums as 'rollups'.

## The rollup manager

In order to achieve the afore-mentioned goal, a new smart contract called $\texttt{RollupManager}$ has been written for the purposes of managing creation of rollups and verification of their batches.

Creation of a rollup could mean one of two things:

- Creating and initializing a brand new rollup.
- Incorporating an already existing rollup under the management of the $\texttt{RollupManager}$.

## Creating new rollups

The first scenario involves newly created rollups, which have not yet been initialized, and therefore have an empty state.

When a user triggers the rollup manager's function to create a new rollup, the $\texttt{RollupManager}$ should

- Populate the configuration parameters,
- Initialize the rollup by generating and writing the genesis block, 
- Sequence transactions for initializing the bridge contract attached to the rollup.

The figure below depicts the process of creating and initializing a new rollup instance. 

Observe that the state tree is empty in this situation.

## Incorporating existing rollups

When an operational rollup is already present on the Ethereum network, a user with the necessary rights can incorporate it into the Rollup Manager for centralized management.

In this scenario, the consensus needs no initialization because the rollup, its genesis block, and corresponding Bridge, have already been established.

The diagram below depicts integration of an existing and operational rollup into the $\texttt{RollupManager}$, and showcases the process which needs no initialization because the rollup is already established. 

In this case, the state tree has information, and this is simply added to the manager.

## Rollup types

Each new rollup has a $\texttt{RollupType}$ attribute attached to it. And it specifies the following parameters: 

- The **consensus implementation address**, which is the address of the contract responsible for sequencing batches.
- The **verifier address** which implements the $\texttt{IVerifierRollup}$ interface. The interface enables verification of each proof sent by the aggregator.
- The $\texttt{forkID}$, for tracking changes in the rollup processing.
- A **rollup compatibility identifier**, which is used to prevent compatibility errors when the rollup needs an *upgrade*.
- The **obsolete flag**, which is a flag for indicating whether the rollup is obsolete or not.
- The **genesis block**, which is the rollup's initial block and can include a small initial state.

Note that several rollups can be of the same $\texttt{RollupType}$​, which means they all share consensus and batch verification smart contracts.

The $\texttt{RollupManager}$ contract has functions; $\texttt{addNewRollupType()}$ and $\texttt{obsoleteRollupType()}$ for adding or obsoleting a rollup type.

It is not possible to create a new rollup of an obsolete rollup type.

## Rollup data

Although several rollups can be of the same $\texttt{RollupType}$, it's important for each rollup store its state data. This state data is included in a structure called $\texttt{RollupData\{\}}$.

The $\texttt{RollupData\{\}}$ struct contains; 

- Information about the current state of the rollup (e.g., The current batch being sequenced or verified, the states root for each batch, etc.)
- Information about the bridge within the rollup, such as the current local exit root.
- Data about forced batches, which is documented [here](https://docs.polygon.technology/zkEVM/architecture/protocol/malfunction-resistance/sequencer-resistance/?h=forced+batches) in the Polygon Knowledge Layer.

## Creating a rollup

Each rollup is associated with either a single rollup type or none.

In order to create a rollup of a certain rollup type, we can use the $\texttt{createNewRollup()}$ function by specifying:

- The associated non-obsolete rollup type identifier, which should be existing.
- The $\texttt{chainID}$ of the rollup, which should be new among the Polygon network's rollup chain IDs.
- The address of the rollup admin, who is able to update several parameters of the consensus contract. For instance, setting a trusted sequencer or a force batches address.
- The address of the trusted sequencer, which is the node responsible for sending the transaction for executing the $\texttt{sequenceBatches()}$ function.
- The address of the token address used to pay gas fees, in the newly created rollup.


When creating a new rollup, OpenZeppelin's [transparent proxy pattern](https://blog.openzeppelin.com/the-transparent-proxy-pattern) is employed by generating an instance of the $\texttt{PolygonTransparentProxy}$ contract.

During this process, the consensus contract is specified by the rollup type serving as its implementation.

Since the rollup is currently not initialized, the $\texttt{RollupData}$ is partially filled, and stored in the $\texttt{rollupIDToRollupData}$​ mapping within the contract’s storage.

The rollup creation process is concluded by calling the $\texttt{initialize()}$​ function of the consensus, which is in charge of setting previously specified addresses in the consensus contract.

Below is a schematic representation of the transparent proxy pattern within the Rollup Manager context.

Proxies are frequently utilized in Ethereum for upgradability, and the exact usage of proxies in the Polygon zkEVM's upgradability is discussed [here](https://docs.polygon.technology/zkEVM/architecture/protocol/upgradability/).
