This section of the documentation contains guides on how to connect wallets to the Polygon zkEVM network, deploy new or existing Ethereum smart contracts, and bridge assets between Polygon zkEVM and Ethereum.

Developers can herein find guides to setting up an RPC zkNode, spinning up a production zkNode, or even implementing their own fully-fledged zkEVM.

Polygon zkEVM is fully compatible with Ethereum to provide a complete EVM-like UX for both Developers and Users.

Users do not need any special toolings or wallets in order to build or interact with Polygon zkEVM.

Simply switch to the zkEVM RPC and start building on a network with a higher throughput and lower fees.

!!!caution
    Check the list of potential risks associated with the use of Polygon zkEVM in the [Disclosures](../get-started/risk-disclosures.md) section.
