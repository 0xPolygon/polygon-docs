This tutorial takes you through the process of deploying a full zkEVM stack on either testnet or mainnet.

It relies on specific component versions so we have hidden most of the configuration complexity in scripts to make the process straightforward.

## Step-by-step

The process is split into the following sections:

1. [Overview of the full environment](environment-overview.md).

2. [Prerequisite steps](prerequisites.md): Preliminary setup, checking system requirements, and prerequisite variables.

3. [Install dependencies](install-dependencies.md): Install required dependencies and downloading mainnet files.

4. [Create wallets](create-wallets.md): Create wallets and deploy contracts.

5. [Configure node deployment](configure-node-deployment.md): Deploy the zkRollup EVM-compatible node.

6. [Configure prover](configure-prover.md): Configure the prover database and the prover service.

7. [Start node](start-node.md): Start the node.

8. [Start services](start-services.md): Start the services.
