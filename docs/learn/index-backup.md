The Polygon Knowledge Layer consists of two parts. Firstly, documents that developers need in order to build with Polygon protocols. Secondly, resources necessary for learning about Polygon technologies.

The Learn section outlines scaling technologies, both live and in-development Polygon protocols, with the intention to display how they will all fit together. 
As these scaling technologies go live, details of the concepts will in tandem be documented and published.

This section gives you a peek into the future, the Polygon 2.0 vision which is community-driven.

## Polygon 2.0: The basics

Polygon technologies will help developers build in an elastically scalable and unified ecosystem of ZK-powered Layer 2s on Ethereum, where users can create, program and exchange value.

The Polygon 2.0 vision is a unified multichain ecosystem. A web of interoperable ZK-powered Ethereum L2s, with near-instant and atomic L2 <> L2 transactions, and designed to empower developers to build without limitations. Developers will choose to build dApps, design and launch dedicated application-specific L2 chains, or migrate existing EVM Layer 1 chains to become an L2.

The endgame of Polygon 2.0 is for developers to build in an environment that feels and functions more like the internet. This means a blockchain ecosystem that can scale without limit, seamlessly unified, and backed by the decentralization and security of Ethereum.

### Zero-knowledge is the key

Fundamentally, building this web of ZK-powered L2s comes down to one challenge: trustless, off-chain computation. In order to scale Ethereum, one needs to preserve Ethereumâ€™s execution logic while making it more efficient. 

The best way to accomplish this goal is through zero-knowledge cryptography as it is capable of providing verifiable proofs that attest to the integrity of off-chain computations. Otherwise, scaling technologies often have to add additional social-economic mechanisms to mediate off-chain computations. The consequence of which is delayed settlement of transactions.

Polygon 2.0 applies the open source, zero-knowledge scaling technology developed at Polygon Labs, and this will allow Ethereum to scale to the limits of the internet.
