Wallet widget is a UI tool which can be embedded in any web application for executing bridge transactions - Deposit & Withdraw. 

Every widget is identified by an unique name which you can get from [Widget dashboard](https://wallet.polygon.technology/widget-dashboard) .

### Widget dashboard

Widget can be created from the widget dashboard page in the wallet application. It allows the user to create a new widget with some customisable options.

Once the widget is created, You can copy code snippet and add it in your application or use the widget name and configure by yourself.

Here is link to widget dashboard -

* mainnet - https://wallet.polygon.technology/widget-dashboard
* testnet - https://wallet-dev.polygon.technology/widget-dashboard

## Install

Widget is exported as javascript library and available as npm package. 

```bash 
npm i @maticnetwork/wallet-widget
```

## Examples

We have created examples for different framework and tools to help you with the development. All examples are present at - [https://github.com/maticnetwork/wallet-widget-example](https://github.com/maticnetwork/wallet-widget-example)

## How to use
### With target

Consider you have a button in your app and you want to show widget when clicked on that button - 

```html
<button id="btnMaticWidget"></btn>
```

```javascript
import { Widget } from "@maticnetwork/wallet-widget";

var widget = new Widget({
    appName: "<widget name>", //widget name from dashboard
    target: '#btnMaticWidget', // element selector for showing widget on click
    network: 'mainnet' // network to be used - testnet or mainnet
});
```

Create widget whenever you are ready. It is best to call create function after document is loaded.

```javascript 
await widget.create();
```
widget is created, now click on your button and widget will be shown.

### Without target

```javascript
import { Widget } from "@maticnetwork/wallet-widget";

var widget = new Widget({
    appName: "<widget name>", //widget name from dashboard
    network: 'mainnet' // network to be used - testnet or mainnet
});

await widget.create();
```

widget is now created, but in order to show the widget - you will have to call `show` API.

```
widget.show();
```

Similarly you can hide the widget, by calling `hide` API.

```
widget.hide();
```

### Important Note 👉

1. Based on network "testnet" or "mainnet", you need to create your app on respective dashboard. We recommend to create app with same name on both testnet & mainnet, so that you don't have any issue when you are changing network.

2. Wallet widget is UI Library and on different website it will look different & might have some issues like - colors, responsiveness etc. So please spend some time on testing and customizing. In case of any help needed - please reach out to [support team](https://support.polygon.technology/).

3. Wallet widget is full screen in mobile devices but you can customize it by `style` configuration.

## Events

})
