!!! info "Transitioning to POL"

    Polygon network is transitioning from MATIC to POL, which will serve as the gas and staking token on Polygon PoS. Use the links below to learn more:

[MATIC](https://etherscan.io/token/0x7D1AfA7B718fb893dB30A3aBc0Cfc608AaCfeBB0) is a native cryptocurrency that served as the gas token on Polygon PoS, analogous to how ETH functions within the Ethereum ecosystem.

To engage with the Polygon PoS network, users previously used MATIC tokens to cover gas fees for transactions, smart contract interactions, and as a part of the network's security model via staking.

This is an [example script](https://gist.github.com/rahuldamodar94/ea3bc4c551e6fc2d318767dcd7e5bffe) to send MATIC tokens from one account to another on the Polygon chain.

!!! info "MATIC rewards"

    Validator and staking rewards will now be distributed in the form of POL tokens.

You can obtain test MATIC for testing purposes on the Amoy testnet. Testnet tokens don't hold any real-world value. This can be done via the Polygon faucet in the following way:

1. Visit the [Polygon Faucet](https://faucet.polygon.technology/).
2. Select MATIC Token.
3. Choose the **Polygon PoS (Amoy)** network.
4. Enter your account address and confirm.

For interactions between Sepolia and Amoy, consider using tools like [Matic.js](https://maticnetwork.github.io/matic.js/), or use the [Polygon Portal](https://portal.polygon.technology/).
