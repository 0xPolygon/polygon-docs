!!! danger "Important update"

    There is a proposal to transition the native token of the Polygon PoS network from MATIC to POL. Please find more information [here](https://polygon.technology/blog/polygon-2-0-implementation-officially-begins-the-first-set-of-pips-polygon-improvement-proposals-released).

[MATIC](https://etherscan.io/token/0x7D1AfA7B718fb893dB30A3aBc0Cfc608AaCfeBB0) serves as the native cryptocurrency for the Polygon PoS network, analogous to how ETH functions within the Ethereum ecosystem.

To engage with the Polygon PoS network, users must use MATIC tokens, which are necessary to cover gas fees for transactions, smart contract interactions, and part of the network's security model via staking.

This is an [example script](https://gist.github.com/rahuldamodar94/ea3bc4c551e6fc2d318767dcd7e5bffe) to send MATIC tokens from one account to another on the Polygon chain.

!!! info "Acquiring MATIC"

    MATIC tokens can be acquired through methods such as validator rewards, staking, or by purchasing them on the open market.

You can obtain test MATIC for testing purposes on the Amoy testnet. Testnet tokens don't hold any real-world value. This can be done via the Polygon faucet in the following way:

1. Visit the [Polygon Faucet](https://faucet.polygon.technology/).
2. Select MATIC Token.
3. Choose the **Polygon PoS (Amoy)** network.
4. Enter your account address and confirm.

For interactions between Sepolia and Amoy, consider using tools like [Matic.js](https://maticnetwork.github.io/matic.js/), or use the [Polygon Portal](https://portal.polygon.technology/).
