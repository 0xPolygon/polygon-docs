This subsection contains details on the requirements users need in order to setup the different types of Polygon PoS nodes, and guides on how to setup each type of a Polygon PoS node.

Polygon PoS users can participate in the network in various ways. Depending on the extent to which each user wishes to participate and their individual computational capacity, they can connect to the network as; Full nodes, Validator nodes, Access nodes, Archive nodes or Erigon nodes. Details on each of these nodes, and their requirements, are elaborated on in the ensuing sub-subsections.
