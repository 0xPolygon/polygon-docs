## Overview

The technical upgrade from MATIC to POL marks a critical juncture for the Polygon networks, enhancing utility and aligning with the vision as an aggregated network of blockchains. 

POL will serve as a hyperproductive token: the native gas and staking token on Polygon PoS, as well as supporting the network's future expansion and security as an aggregated network.

## Steps to migrate to POL

3. Select the **Networks** tab from left sidebar to bring up the network settings. Switch to **Polygon Mainnet** if you're currently on another network. The list of configuration options on the right shows the **Currency symbol** which is currently set to **MATIC**.

The process to change the token symbol may vary depending on the wallet you're using. Please refer to the docs specific to your wallet and follow the outlined steps accordingly.

### MATIC tokens on Polygon zkEVM

If your MATIC tokens are on the zkEVM chain, use [Polygon Portal](https://portal.polygon.technology/bridge) to bridge your tokens to Ethereum, and then follow the steps described in the [MATIC tokens on Ethereum section](#matic-tokens-on-ethereum).
