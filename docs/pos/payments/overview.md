## Fastest, Ultra-Low Cost Transactions

With the upgrade to Heimdall v2, deterministic finality on Polygon chain is now achieved between 2-5 seconds thanks to the 1-2 seconds block time in Heimdall, meaning miletones are voted on and finalized much faster.

Fast finality means payments will be immediately available for your users.
