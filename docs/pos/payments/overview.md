In this section, we'll cover what Polygon offers for payment developers.

## Fast & Affordable Finality

With the upgrade to Heimdall v2, deterministic finality on Polygon chain is now achieved between 2-5 seconds thanks to the 1-2 seconds block time in Heimdall, meaning miletones are voted on and finalized much faster.

This offers fast finality with reliability on payments made on Polygon.
