# x402 on Polygon

x402 is an open payment protocol that brings blockchain payments 
into a familiar web standard. By re-using the HTTP `402 Payment Required` 
status code, it lets developers handle on-chain and agentic payments with 
the same tools they already use for APIs and web services.

Instead of building complex wallet integrations or subscription systems, 
**developers can simply treat payments like another part of the HTTP request/response 
cycle.** This lowers the barrier for web2 developers experimenting with crypto, 
while also giving web3 builders a lightweight way to support pay-per-use APIs, 
agent-to-agent transactions, and micropayments.
