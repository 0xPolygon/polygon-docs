# x402 on Polygon

x402 is an open payment protocol that brings blockchain payments 
into a familiar web standard. By re-using the HTTP `402 Payment Required` 
status code, it lets developers handle on-chain and agentic payments with 
the same tools they already use for APIs and web services.

Instead of building complex wallet integrations or subscription systems, 
**developers can simply treat payments like another part of the HTTP request/response 
cycle.** This lowers the barrier for web2 developers experimenting with crypto, 
while also giving web3 builders a lightweight way to support pay-per-use APIs, 
agent-to-agent transactions, and micropayments.

## Access on Polygon

Polygon currently supports x402 on Mainnet and Amoy through the following facilitators:

1. [x402.rs Facilitator Endpoint](https://facilitator.x402.rs/)
2. [ThirdWeb](https://playground.thirdweb.com/payments/x402)
3. Polygon Self-Hosted Facilitator (Contact for access)

The following guides will show how to use x402 on Polygon. The x402 community also has
created [multiple examples](https://github.com/coinbase/x402/tree/main/examples/typescript) 
which can be easily adapted.
