Polygon brings you a trustless two-way transaction channel between Polygon PoS and Ethereum by introducing the cross-chain bridge. With this users can transfer tokens across Polygon PoS without incurring third-party risks and market liquidity limitations. 

The PoS Bridge is available on both Mumbai Testnet as well as Polygon PoS Mainnet. You can access it and bridge assets over to Polygon PoS using the [Polygon Wallet Suite](https://wallet.polygon.technology/polygon/bridge/deposit).

Polygon PoS bridge provides a bridging mechanism that is near-instant, low-cost, and quite flexible.

There is no change to the circulating supply of your token when it crosses the bridge;

- Tokens that leave the Ethereum network are locked and the same number of tokens are minted on Polygon PoS as a pegged token (1:1).
- To move the tokens back to the Ethereum network, tokens are burned on Polygon PoS network and unlocked on Ethereum network during the process.
