The system requirements listed in this section are both for the Sentry node and the Validator node.

The **minimum** system requirements mean you can run the nodes but the setup is not future-proof.

The **recommended** system requirements mean the nodes are future-proof. There is, however, no upper limit to future-proofing your nodes.

You must always run the sentry node and the validator node on separate machines.
