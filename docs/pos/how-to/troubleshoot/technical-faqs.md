### 1. Are the private keys same for Heimdall and Bor keystore?

Yes, the private key used for generating Validator keys and Bor Keystore is the same.
The private key used in this instance is your Wallet's ETH address where your Polygon
testnet tokens are stored.

### 3. `Error: Failed to unlock account (0x...) No key for given address or file`

This error occurs because the path for the `password.txt` file is incorrect. You can follow the below steps to rectify this:

This error occurs because the path for the `password.txt` and Keystore file is incorrect. You can follow the below steps to rectify this:

1. Copy the bor keystore file to

    `/etc/bor/dataDir/keystore`

2. And `password.txt` to

    `/etc/bor/dataDir/`

3. Make sure you have added correct address in `/etc/bor/metadata`.


##### For binaries

1. Copy the Bor keystore file to:

    `/var/lib/bor/keystore/`

2. And password.txt to

    `/var/lib/bor/password.txt`


### 4. `Error: Wrong Block.Header.AppHash. Expected xxxx`

This usually occurs due to an incorrect installation of heimdall. You can follow the steps below to rectify this:

  Run
   ```bash
   heimdalld unsafe-reset-all
   ```
and start Heimdall services again. You can refer to this [guide](../validator/prerequisites.md).


### 5. From where do I create the API key?

You can access this link: [https://infura.io/register](https://infura.io/register) . Make sure that once you have setup your account and project, you copy the API key for Sepolia and not mainnet.

Mainnet is selected by default.

### 6. Heimdall isn't working. I'm getting a panic error

Example: My `heimdalld` isn’t working. In the log the first line is:

```bash
panic: Unknown db_backend leveldb, expected either goleveldb or memdb or fsdb
```

Solution: Change the config to `goleveldb` in `config.toml`.


### 7. How do I delete remnants of Heimdall and Bor?

If you want to delete remnants of Heimdall and Bor then you can run the following commands
Bor:

##### For Linux package

```$ sudo dpkg -i matic-bor```

And delete Bor directory using:

```$ sudo rm -rf /etc/bor```

##### For binaries

```$ sudo rm -rf /etc/bor```

And then run:

```$ sudo rm /etc/heimdall```


### 8. How many validators can be active concurrently?

Under the current limit, a maximum of 105 validators can be active at any given time. It's important to note that active validators are primarily those with high uptime, while participants with significant downtime may be removed.

### 9. How much should I stake?

Set the `stake-amount` and `heimdall-fee-amount` values according to the logic described below.

A minimum of 10 Matic tokens is required for the stake amount whereas heimdall fee should be greater than 10. For example, your stake amount is 400 then the heimdall fee should be 20. We suggest to keep the Heimdall fee as 20.

However, please note that the values entered in stake amount and `heimdal-fee-amount` should be entered in 18 decimals.

For example,

```bash
heimdallcli stake --staked-amount 400000000000000000000  --fee-amount 1000000000000000000 --validator 0xf8d1127780b89f167cb4578935e89b8ea1de774f
```

### 10. I was selected to become a validator but my ETH address was incorrect. What do I do?

If you have access to the ETH address that you submitted earlier then you can transfer the test tokens from that account to the current account. And then you can initiate your process of setting up your nodes.

If you don't have access to that ETH address, we won't be transferring you tokens separately. You can re-register in the form again with the correct ETH address.

### 11. I'm getting an error starting the bridge

Error: Object "start" is unknown, try "bridge help". Is it still OK to ignore this?

Check "which bridge" - if it's `/usr/sbin/bridge` you're not running the right "bridge" program.

Try `~/go/bin/bridge` instead `(or $GOBIN/bridge)`.


### 12. I'm getting `dpkg` error

Error: "dpkg: error processing archive matic-heimdall_1.0.0_amd64.deb (--install): trying to overwrite '/heimdalld-rest-server.service', which is also in package matic-node 1.0.0"

This occurs mainly because of a previous installation of Polygon on your machine. To resolve you can run:

`sudo dpkg -r matic-node`


### 13. I'm not clear on which Private Key should I add when I generate validator key

The private key to be used is your wallet's ETH address where your Polygon testnet tokens are stored. You can complete the setup with one public-private key pair tied to the address submitted on the form.


### 14. Is there a way to know if Heimdall is synced?

You can run the following command to check it:

```bash
$ curl [http://localhost:26657/status](http://localhost:26657/status)
```

Check the value of the `catching_up` flag. If it is `false` then the node is all synced up.


### 15. If someone becomes a top 10 staker, how do they receive their MATIC reward?

Stage 1 rewards are not based on stake. Participants with high stake don't automatically qualify for a reward in this stage.


### 16. What should the Heimdall version be?

To check your Heimdall version you can simply run:

```bash
heimdalld version
```

The correct version of Heimdall for stage 1 should be `heimdalld version is beta-1.1-rc1-213-g2bfd1ac`


### 17. What values should I add in the stake amount and fee amount?

A minimum of 10 Matic tokens is required for the stake amount whereas heimdall fee should be greater than 10. For example, your stake amount is 400 then the heimdall fee should be 20. We suggest to keep the Heimdall fee as 20.

However, please note that the values entered in stake amount and `heimdal-fee-amount` should be entered in 18 decimals.

For example,

```bash
heimdallcli stake --staked-amount 400000000000000000000  --fee-amount 1000000000000000000 --validator 0xf8d1127780b89f167cb4578935e89b8ea1de774f
```


### 18. What's the difference between `/var/lib/heimdall` and `/etc/heimdall?`

`/var/lib/heimdall` is the heimdall dir when you use the binary installation method. `/etc/heimdall` is for the Linux package installation method.


### 19. When I make the stake transaction, I'm getting "Gas Exceeded" error

This error may occur because of the stake or fee amount format. The values entered during the stake command need to have 18 decimals.

However, please note that the values entered in stake amount and `heimdal-fee-amount` should be entered in 18 decimals.

For example,

```bash
heimdallcli stake --staked-amount 400000000000000000000  --fee-amount 1000000000000000000 --validator 0xf8d1127780b89f167cb4578935e89b8ea1de774f
```


### 20. When will I get a chance to become a Validator?

We are progressively adding validators throughout the course of Stage 1 event. We will be releasing a list of new external validators gradually. This list will be announced on the [Discord channel](https://discord.com/invite/0xPolygonCommunity).


### 21. Where can I find Heimdall account info location?

For binaries: `/var/lib/heimdall/config folder`

For Linux package: `/etc/heimdall/config`


### 22. Which file do I add the API key in?

Once you have created the API key, you need to add it to the `heimdall-config.toml` file.


### 23. Which file do I add the persistent_peers?

You can add the persistent_peers in the following file: `/var/lib/heimdall/config/config.toml`


### 24. “Did you reset Tendermint without resetting your application's data?”

In such a case you can reset heimdall config data and try running the installation again.

```bash
$ heimdalld unsafe-reset-all
$ rm -rf $HEIMDALLDIR/bridge
```

### 25. Error: Unable to unmarshall config Error 1 error(s) decoding

Error: `* '' has invalid keys: clerk_polling_interval, matic_token, span_polling_interval, stake_manager_contract, stakinginfo_contract`

This occurs mostly because when there are typos, or some missing parts or an old config file which is still a remnant. You will need to clear all the remnants and then try setting it up again.

### 26. To stop Heimdall and Bor services

##### For Linux packages

Stop Heimdall: `sudo service heimdalld stop`

Stop Bor: `sudo service bor stop` or

1. `ps -aux | grep bor`. Get the PID for Bor and then run the following command.
2. `sudo kill -9 PID`

##### For binaries

Stop Heimdall: `pkill heimdalld`

Stop Bridge: `pkill heimdalld-bridge`

Stop Bor: Go to CS-2001/bor and then run, `bash stop.sh`

### 27. To remove Heimdall and Bor directories

##### For Linux packages

Delete Heimdall: `sudo rm -rf /etc/heimdall/*`

Delete Bor: `sudo rm -rf /etc/bor/*`

##### For binaries

Delete Heimdall: `sudo rm -rf /var/lib/heimdall/`

Delete Bor: `sudo rm -rf /var/lib/bor`

### 28. What to do when you get `Wrong Block.Header.AppHash.` error

If your node fails with an `appHash` error, you'll need to restore it using a snapshot. See the [guide available here](../../how-to/snapshots.md).

Please make sure you are either using the chain flag in your service file, or the chain flag is set in your `config/heimdall-config.toml` file.

If you are using Docker, please specify the chain flag in your `config/heimdall-config.toml` file.
