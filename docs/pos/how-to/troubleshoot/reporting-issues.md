## Where to report a bug

For any bugs or attacks that are discovered, you need to report them to the [Immunefi bug bounty program](https://immunefi.com/bounty/polygon/). 

!!!info
    Performing an attack and not providing submission of your proof will result in disqualification of your attempt.

Make sure you add all relevant details such as your email address and Discord ID. Providing ample details creates a rapport of communication, and helps the Polygon team evaluate your submission appropriately.

## What happens after submitting a report

Once an issue is reported, the Polygon team reviews it, comments, and updates on the status of the issue. After evaluation, the Polygon team reports the outcome of the submission. The severity of the issue also gets tagged as per the evaluation.
