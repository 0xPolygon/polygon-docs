# Agglayer Architecture

## Overview

**The Agglayer** is designed to provide an interoperability framework for cross-chain communication and state verification that robust, scalable, and flexible enough to support these features between unalike blockchain networks. The key components of the Agglayer include the **Agglayer node**, the **pessimistic proof**, and the **unified bridge**. They are designed to enable lightweight, secure, and verifiable cross-chain transactions.

## Agglayer node

The **Agglayer Node** is a Rust-based service responsible for processing and verifying zero-knowledge (ZK) proofs from chains connected to the Agglayer. 

### Key functions:
- **Zero-knowledge proof verification**: The node receives and verifies cryptographic proofs from connected chains before sending them to L1.
- **Certificate management**: Handles certificates that attest to the state transitions of connected chains.
- **Orchestration of epochs**: Manages state updates in a structured manner through epochs.

## Pessimistic proof

The **pessimistic proof** mechanism ensures that any withdrawal claims made to the Agglayer are backed by legitimate deposits in the **Unified Bridge**. It uses a novel zero-knowledge proof system implemented in Rust, leveraging the **SP1 zkVM** and the **Plonky3 proving system**.

### Key functions:
- **Security validation**: Ensures that each chain connected to the Agglayer remains as secure as if it were operating independently.
- **State consistency**: Provides a complete view of all token and message transfers occurring across the Agglayer.
- **Fraud prevention**: Prevents chains from withdrawing more assets than they have legitimately received.

## Unified bridge

The **unified bridge** is responsible for maintaining the data structures related to chain states, cross-chain transactions, and the Agglayerâ€™s Global Exit Root, ensuring cross-chain transactions are indeed finalized on the L1 before they can be claimed.  

### Key functions:
- **Cross-chain asset transfers**: Allows users to bridge assets between different chains.
- **Message passing**: Enables contract-to-contract interactions across chains.
- **State management and accounting**: Maintains Merkle proofs that ensure transactions are finalized before being processed on the destination chain.
