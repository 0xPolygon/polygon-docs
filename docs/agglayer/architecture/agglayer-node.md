# Agglayer Node

## Overview

**The Agglayer node** is the Rust-based service designed to receive zero-knowledge proofs from Agglayer-connected chains, verify their validity, and send them to the L1 for final settlement. 

!!! note
      Instructions on how to clone and build the Agglayer locally, including running the pessimistic proof test suite and generating a verifiable proof using Succinctâ€™s Prover Network, can be found [here](https://github.com/agglayer/agglayer/blob/main/README.md)
