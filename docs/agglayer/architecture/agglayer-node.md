# Agglayer Node

## Overview

**The Agglayer node** is the Rust-based service designed to receive zero-knowledge proofs from Agglayer-connected chains, verify their validity, and send them to the L1 for final settlement. 

> **Note:** Instructions on how to clone and build the Agglayer locally, including running the pessimistic proof test suite and generating a verifiable proof using Succinct’s Prover Network, can be found [here](#).

## Crate directory

The crates and their functions within the Agglayer repo are as follows:
